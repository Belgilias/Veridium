# The Cacophony Strain

**[[The Cacophony Strain]]** is a theorized threat in [[Veridium]], believed by some to be the external cause of the [[Great Dissonance]].

Its current status and nature are subjects of speculation:
* It might still be subtly corrupting [[Veridium]].
* It could be seeking re-entry into the world.

Understanding or combating [[The Cacophony Strain]] could be a major underlying goal for those seeking to heal [[Veridium]] or prevent a "[[Second Dissonance]]".
