# The Sundered Isles & The Shattered Concord (The Dissonance Frontier)

The **[[Sundered Isles]]** are the most accessible fringe of a far larger, catastrophically shattered continental region known as the **[[Shattered Concord]]**. This vast expanse is a maelstrom of floating islands, Dissonance storms, gravitational anomalies, and exposed [[Architect]] under-structures. This entire area is considered the [[Dissonance Frontier]]. Development of advanced seafaring and salvage techniques to explore coastal [[Architect]] ruins occurred here during the [[The Age of Discovery]].

* **Biomes (Sundered Isles portion)**: [[Volcanic Archipelagos]], [[Floating Forests]] & [[Sargasso Jungles]], [[Graveyard Deeps]], [[Coral Labyrinths]].
* **Biomes (Deeper within Shattered Concord - more extreme)**: [[Aetheric Storm Fronts]], [[Gravity Shears]], [[Islands of Frozen Time]], [[Shard Fields]] (crystallized Dissonance energy).
* **Key Locations & [[Architect]] Remnants**:
    * **[[The Well of Whispers]]** ([[Sundered Isles]] - Submerged Ruin): An [[Architect]] structure emitting complex sonic patterns. Rumored to be a communication device or a library of [[Architect]] "songs".
    * **[[The Shifting Shoals of Anachronos]]** ([[Sundered Isles]]/Edge of [[Shattered Concord]]): An area where numerous temporal anomalies converge, causing islands to appear and disappear, and ships/creatures from different eras to become wrecked or manifest. (Likely frequented by [[Captain Glitch Anachronos]] and his [[Chronos Scavengers]]).
    * **[[The Lost City of Aethel]]** (Rumored within the [[Shattered Concord]]): An entire [[Architect]] Metropolis, a major [[Source Node]], believed to be trapped in a temporal loop or pocket dimension by the [[Great Dissonance]]. Its reappearance or discovery would send shockwaves through [[Veridium]].
    * **[[The Dissonance Core]]** (Deep within [[Shattered Concord]] - Legendary/Hypothetical): A theoretical point of absolute Dissonant energy, perhaps where the cataclysm originated or is still actively "bleeding" into [[Veridium]]. Reaching it would be an epic, reality-bending quest.
* **Primary Inhabitants**: [[Chronos Scavengers]].
* **Associated Creatures/Anomalies**: [[Temporal Phantoms]], [[Chronal Ectoplasm]], [[Dissonance Hounds]], [[Reality Weavers]], [[Echo Storm Elementals]], Corrupted [[Architect Sentinels]], [[Source Code Elementals]], [[Reality Glitches]], [[Leviathans of the Shattered Deeps]].
