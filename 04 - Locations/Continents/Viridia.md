# Viridia (The Living Continent / The Verdant Labyrinth)

[[Viridia]] is a massive super-continent teeming with hyper-diverse, often aggressively evolving life. Much of [[Viridia]] is covered by colossal, ancient forests, sprawling bio-engineered landscapes, and untamed jungles where the [[World-Song]] resonates with vibrant, primal energy. It is the primary domain of the [[Symbiotic Spires]] and the sacred heartland of the [[Silent Weald]]. First attempts at understanding and manipulating "living code" and rudimentary bio-shaping occurred here during the [[The Age of Discovery]].

* **Biomes**: [[Spirejungles]], [[Primal Weald]] ([[Silent Weald]]), [[Chitin Plains]], [[Bloomwater Swamps]] & [[Bioluminescent Deltas]].
* **Key Locations & [[Architect]] Remnants**:
    * **[[The Gene-Forge of Viridia]]** (Deep within [[Spirejungles]]): A vast, cavernous, subterranean [[Architect]] bio-laboratory, still pulsing with raw creative and mutative energies. The [[Symbiotic Spires]] vie for control over its "output," while the [[Silent Weald]] seeks to contain its influence. Guarded by terrifyingly evolved flora and fauna, and potentially automated [[Architect]] bio-guardians. This is a major [[Source Node]]. [[Symbiotic Spires]] shamans consider [[Architect]] Gene-Forges sacred sites.
    * **[[The World-Tree Enclave]]** ([[Primal Weald]]): Not a single location but a sacred region centered around several colossal, interconnected, and unimaginably ancient trees believed to be direct conduits to the purest form of the [[World-Song]]. The spiritual heart of the [[Silent Weald]], fiercely protected. Some believe [[The World-Tree]] itself is a conscious fragment of the [[World-Song]].
    * **[[The Petrified Garden of Xylos]]** ([[Primal Weald]]): An entire grove where all life was instantly turned to a stone-like, unidentifiable, and incredibly durable substance. An [[Architect]] experiment gone wrong? A localized [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]] pulse? The site is eerily silent. ("Xylos, the Weaver of Forms" was named as an [[Elder Architects|Elder Architect]]).
* **Dominant Factions**: [[Symbiotic Spires]], [[Silent Weald]].
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Gene-Twisted Aberrations]], [[Spore-Zombies]], [[Fungal Horrors]], [[Apex Bio-Predators]], [[Living Siege Engines]], [[Bio-Titans]], [[Symbiotic Horrors]], [[Bloomwilde Terrors]] (from [[The Bloomwilde Contagion]]), [[Elder Groots]], [[Awakened Trees]], [[Spirit Beasts]], [[Will-o'-the-Wisps]], Corrupted Sprites, [[Shambling Mounds of Infused Earth]], [[Living Topiaries]], [[Guardians of the Threshold]], [[Echoes of the Song]].
