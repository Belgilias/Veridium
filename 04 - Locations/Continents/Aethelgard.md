# Aethelgard (The Cogwork Continent)

[[Aethelgard]] is the heartland of the [[Cogwork Concord]], a sprawling continent dominated by imposing mountain ranges rich in coal, iron, and other vital minerals. Its central regions are heavily industrialized, with smoke-stack cities like **[[Aethelburg]]** interconnected by vast railway networks and powered by harnessed geothermal vents and roaring steam engines. Early experiments with steam power derived from geothermal [[Architect]] tech occurred here during the [[The Age of Discovery]].

* **Biomes**: [[Iron Peaks]], [[Cinder Barrens]], [[Gearwood Forests]], [[Steam-Veiled Coasts]].
* **Key Locations & [[Architect]] Remnants**:
    * **[[The Sky-Anchor of Aethelgard]]** ([[Iron Peaks]]): A titanic, impossibly smooth metallic spire of [[Architect]] origin piercing the clouds, humming with ancient power. Believed by some to be a continental stabilizer or a mooring point for ancient [[Architect]] sky-vessels. Its energy fields disrupt crude mortal technologies but might empower specific [[Architect]] artifacts.
    * **[[Aethelburg's Undercity]]** (Beneath [[Aethelburg]]): A labyrinth of abandoned steam tunnels, forgotten maintenance shafts, collapsed sections of older city layers, and even sealed [[Architect]] conduits. Home to outcasts, mutated creatures, and secrets best left undisturbed, possibly including hidden labs related to projects like the [[Project Chimera|Chimera Protocol]]/[[The Aethelburg Algorithm]].
    * **[[The Geothermal Nexus]]** ([[Iron Peaks]]): A vast network of [[Architect]]-designed geothermal taps, now dangerously unstable but providing much of the [[Cogwork Concord]]'s raw power. Rumored to connect to a planetary core regulator.
* **Dominant Faction**: [[Cogwork Concord]].
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Gear-Golems]], Rogue Automatons, [[Smog Mephits]], [[Toxin Elementals]], [[Scrap-Raptors]], [[Junkyard Stalkers]], [[The Brass Colossus]], [[Iron Behemoths]], [[Aether-Wraiths]], [[Source-Leeches]].
