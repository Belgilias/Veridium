# Krystallos (The Shifting Sands / The Mind's Peak)

[[Krystallos]] is a largely arid and mountainous continent, known for its vast crystalline deserts, soaring, often uninhabitable peaks, and regions where reality seems thin and mutable due to high concentrations of psychic energy or raw, unstable [[s]]. The [[Aetheric Ascendancy]] has established its primary enclaves here. Recognition of psionically resonant crystals and the dawning of mental disciplines occurred here during the [[The Age of Discovery]].

* **Biomes**: [[Resonant Deserts]], [[Shard Mountains]], [[Echoing Canyons]] & [[Whispering Chills]], [[Temporal Wastes]]. [[Chronos Scavengers]] have outposts in the [[Temporal Wastes]].
* **Key Locations & [[Architect]] Remnants**:
    * **[[The Orrery of Worlds]]** ([[Resonant Deserts]]): A colossal, still partially functioning [[Architect]] orrery, possibly housed within a massive geode. Its complex components are made of unknown crystals and metals, and it supposedly maps not just [[Veridium]] but other potential realities. Its emitted light and resonant frequencies can induce prophetic visions or madness. A powerful [[Source Node]].
    * **[[The Singing Caverns]]** ([[Shard Mountains]]): Deep within the mountains, these caverns have crystalline formations that vibrate with the pure [[World-Song]], creating audible, ethereal music. Prolonged exposure can heighten psionic abilities or shatter unstable minds.
    * **[[The City of Silent Thought]]** (Location Varies/Hidden): A legendary [[Aetheric Ascendancy]] sanctuary said to exist entirely on a mental plane, or in a location shielded by immense psychic barriers.
    * **[[Aetheric Ascendancy]] Enclaves**: [[The Crystal Spire of Althazar]], [[The Silent Monolith of Xy'on]], [[Floating Sanctum of Aerthos]].
* **Dominant Faction**: [[Aetheric Ascendancy]]. [[Chronos Scavengers]] also present.
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Thought Eaters]], [[Intellect Devourers]], [[Crystalline Golems (Thought-Forms)]], [[Mind Warpers]], [[Psychic Phantoms]], [[Ego Wraiths]], [[Resonance Beasts]], [[Krystallos Sand-Shapers]].
