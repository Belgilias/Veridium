# The World-Song

The **[[World-Song]]** is the fundamental metaphysical structure of [[Veridium]] – not a literal song audible to all, but the underlying vibrational essence, the arcane mathematics, and the flow of energies that define reality, magic, life, and consciousness. It is the natural law of [[Veridium]], imbued with immense power and potential. It's described as the "operating system" of the world.

Before the [[Architects]], [[Veridium]] was a realm of **[[Primordial Chaos]]** – raw, undifferentiated potential. The [[Architects]] brought order by "composing" or "programming" the [[World-Song]].

* **The First Canticle**: The initial act of the [[Primordial Architects]], weaving the primary chords and melodies of the [[World-Song]], establishing the Elemental Primes (foundational energies of earth, air, fire, water, light, shadow, etc.) and the basic laws of physics.
* **The Shaping Chorus**: [[Elder Architects]] and [[Lesser Architects]] then further refined the [[World-Song]], coaxing forth complex ecosystems, shaping continents, and laying the groundwork for intricate life. Early life under their direct guidance was often fluid, hyper-advanced, or purely energetic.

The [[Great Dissonance]] was a cataclysmic event that shattered/corrupted the [[World-Song]] and [[Source Code]] networks. [[Dissonance Hotspots]] are regions where the [[World-Song]] is actively unstable due to the [[Great Dissonance]]. Adventurers may seek to understand or even heal the fractured [[World-Song]]. The [[Silent Weald]] faction shows reverence for the untainted [[World-Song]].
