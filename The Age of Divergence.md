# The Age of Divergence (The Fractured Harmony Epoch)

**(Approx. 500 BPD - Present Day)**

This is the current era of [[Veridium]], characterized by established societal blocs, rapid technological and philosophical acceleration, and intense competition.

* **Key Events**:
    * *Solidification of Societal Blocs*: The distinct cultural and technological identities of the [[Cogwork Concord]], [[Symbiotic Spires]], [[Silent Weald]], [[Aetheric Ascendancy]], and [[Chronos Scavengers]] become firmly established, each with their own territories, ambitions, and methods of exploiting (or preserving) the [[Architects|Architect]]'s legacy.
    * *Technological/Philosophical Acceleration*: Each bloc experiences rapid advancements along its chosen path, leading to increasingly powerful – and often dangerous – applications of [[Source Code]].
        * [[Cogwork Concord]]: Development of advanced automatons, railways, and early airships. Cities like [[Aethelburg]] become centers of industry and invention.
        * [[Symbiotic Spires]]: Mastery of gene-crafting, creation of vast bio-engineered structures and war-beasts.
        * [[Silent Weald]]: Deepening communion with primal nature, potent elemental and spiritual magic.
        * [[Aetheric Ascendancy]]: Refinement of psionic disciplines, creation of mind-powered constructs.
    * *[[The Aethelburg Algorithm]] & Similar Crises*: Incidents like [[Project Chimera]] – involving the implantation of neural interface chips to control automatons, derived from [[Professor Elara Vance]]'s research into [[Architects|Architect]]-related technologies – highlight the dangerous, ethically fraught, and consciousness-altering potential of rediscovered [[Source Code]]. Such events become more frequent across [[Veridium]] as ambition outpaces understanding.
    * *The [[Source Code]] Rush Intensifies*: Global competition to find, claim, and exploit uncharted [[Architects|Architect]] ruins and untapped [[Source Code]] reserves fuels espionage, proxy wars, and reckless expeditions.
    * *The Looming Shadow & Whispers of a "[[Second Dissonance]]"*: Sages, mystics, and fringe scientists across [[Veridium]] note an increase in [[Dissonance Hotspot]] activity, reality fraying at the edges, and the [[Awakening Architect Systems|awakening of ancient, ill-understood threats]]. Fear grows that mortal misuse of the [[Source Code]] or the reawakening of major [[Architects|Architect]] systems could trigger a new cataclysm. The "Present Day" is an age of incredible innovation, profound danger, and existential uncertainty.
