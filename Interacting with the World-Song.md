# Interacting with the World-Song

The **[[World-Song]]** is the subtle, vibrational essence of reality in [[Veridium]]. While few can directly "control" it, certain classes and individuals can harmonize with, manipulate, or draw power from its echoes.

* **Bards ([[Songweavers of Veridium]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: Can learn to weave their music and words with the local resonances of the [[World-Song]]. This might allow them to:
        * **Harmonic Resonance**: Boost allies' morale or abilities by aligning them with positive "notes" in the Song.
        * **Dissonant Chord**: Create jarring, localized disruptions in the [[World-Song]] to confuse enemies, briefly nullify minor magical effects, or cause unease.
        * **Environmental Attunement**: Subtly influence the immediate environment (e.g., coax plants to briefly entangle, make stone tremble, or cause winds to shift) by resonating with its "song".
    * They might seek out "Pure Notes" (locations where the [[World-Song]] is particularly strong, like [[The Singing Caverns]]) to learn new abilities or compose powerful "Canticles of Reality".

* **Druids & Rangers ([[Echo Listeners]] of the [[Silent Weald]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: Their connection to nature is a deep attunement to the [[World-Song]] as it manifests in living things and natural phenomena. They can:
        * **Sense Disturbances**: Feel "discord" in the [[World-Song]] caused by unnatural creatures, pollution, or [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]].
        * **Channel Primal Harmony**: Draw upon the Weald's pure song to heal, protect, or call upon nature spirits that are themselves part of the Song. (See also: [[Silent Weald#Core Philosophy|Silent Weald Core Philosophy]])

* **Psions (Certain Disciplines - Resonant Minds of the [[Aetheric Ascendancy]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: Some psions might develop the ability to perceive the "psychic echoes" or "mental frequencies" of the [[World-Song]], interpreting them as emotional currents, premonitions, or the collective unconscious of a region.

* **World-Song Manipulation as a Minor Mechanic**:
    * Consider allowing any character with high Wisdom or Charisma, upon discovering a "Harmonic Locus" or experiencing a profound connection to the world, to gain a temporary boon (like advantage on a specific type of check for a day) or a minor, thematic cantrip-like ability related to the local "song" of that place. This could be a reward for deep roleplaying or exploration.
