# The Chronos Scavengers

* **Core Philosophy**: Survival today, profit tomorrow. Time is a broken river, and they are the driftwood riders. Pragmatism and the thrill of the find are paramount. They have folklore viewing [[Architects]] as Vast, Vanished Conquerors or Careless Landlords.
* **Key Territories**: Nomadic, with temporary outposts in the [[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Sundered Isles]], the [[Temporal Wastes]] of [[Krystallos]], and near major [[Dissonance Hotspots]]. They operate on the [[Dissonance Frontier]].
* **Leadership Example**: [[Captain Glitch Anachronos]] ([[The Time Raiders]] faction).
* **Technological Level**: Anachronistic and eclectic, salvaged and jury-rigged.
* **Culture & Society**: Loosely organized into crews, flotillas, or mobile camps.
* **Internal Divisions & Factions**:
    * **[[The Time Raiders]]**: Aggressive pirates and salvagers, focused on armed acquisition. Often employ unstable, weaponized temporal devices.
    * **[[The Echo Nomads]]**: Explorers and survivalists, skilled at navigating Dissonance zones. Often act as guides or information brokers. More respectful of the past than Raiders.
    * **[[The Paradox Priests]]** (Cult of the Unwound Clock): A dangerous, fatalistic cult even to other Scavengers. They worship the chaotic nature of time and the [[Great Dissonance]] itself, believing that by embracing paradox and temporal instability, they can achieve enlightenment or unlock ultimate power. They actively seek to trigger or manipulate [[Echo Storms]] and temporal anomalies, often with disastrous results for those nearby. They are a splinter group viewed with fear and hostility by many other Scavengers.
* **Inter-Faction Dynamics**:
    * Opportunistic Neutrals. Mistrusted by all. *Nuance*: [[Echo Nomads]] sometimes develop stable, clandestine trade with isolated communities or research outposts. [[The Paradox Priests]] are hunted by almost everyone if their activities become too disruptive or dangerous.
    * [[Cogwork Concord]]: Distrust, but occasionally used for rare salvage.
* **Associated Anomalies/Creatures**: [[Temporal Phantoms]], [[Chronal Ectoplasm]], [[Dissonance Hounds]], [[Reality Weavers]], [[Echo Storm Elementals]], Corrupted [[Architect Sentinels]]. Many creatures from the [[Dissonance Frontier]] are encountered by them.
