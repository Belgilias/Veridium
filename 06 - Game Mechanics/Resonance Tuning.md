# Resonance Tuning

**[[Resonance Tuning]]** is a high-risk, high-reward mechanic allowing player characters to directly interface with or draw power from a [[s]] artifact or field. This is often attempted by Psions of the [[Aetheric Ascendancy]] but may be accessible to others through specific circumstances or abilities. (See also: [[Quick Guide to Veridium#Player Character Focus|Player Character Focus]])

* **Mechanic**:
    * Characters attempting [[Resonance Tuning]] make a check (perhaps tied to their primary spellcasting ability, Wisdom, or Intelligence, with difficulty based on the [[s]]'s complexity and stability).
    * **Critical Success**: Full control/understanding, potentially unlocking a unique boon, a permanent new ability related to the Code, or a flash of [[Architects|Architect]] insight.
    * **Success**: Grants temporary boons (e.g., bonus to certain rolls, temporary hit points, a specific minor power related to the [[s]]'s function) or allows them to activate/understand the device as intended.
    * **Partial Success**: Limited effect, or success with a minor complication (e.g., a surge of unstable energy, a temporary sensory distortion, a minor [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]] backlash like a harmless cosmetic mutation).
    * **Failure**: Could result in backlash (psychic damage, a [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]]-related mutation like a glowing eye or a patch of crystalline skin, the device malfunctioning dangerously, attracting hostile [[Dissonance Entities]] or [[Monsters of Veridium#Anomalies of the Dissonance Frontier|Dissonance creatures]]).
    * **Critical Failure (More Dangerous & Varied)**:
        * **Psychic Overload**: Temporary insanity (per DM's table), uncontrolled telepathic broadcasting of the characterâ€™s deepest fears or thoughts, severe mental stat damage.
        * **Reality Shift/Localized [[Dissonance Hotspots|Dissonance]]**: A small, temporary [[Dissonance Hotspots|Dissonance Hotspot]] forms around the character; localized time skips or loops affecting the character or
          immediate party; sudden, uncontrolled minor mutations (e.g., an extra finger, scales, a vestigial wing) that might be unsettling or offer strange minor abilities/penalties.
        * **Hostile Enhancement Backlash**: Nearby mundane creatures or even inanimate objects briefly become infused with hostile Dissonant energy, gaining temporary malevolent sentience or aggressive enhancements (e.g., Dissonance Mutants).
        * **Source Siphon**: The character is drained of magical energy or life force, empowering the [[s]] artifact or field in an unintended, often dangerous way.
        * **Mental Scarring**: The character gains a new flaw, phobia, or recurring nightmare related to the overwhelming nature of the [[s]] or a glimpse into the [[Architects|Architect]]'s alien mind.
    * The rewards for successful [[Resonance Tuning]] can be significant (e.g., unique mutations that grant new senses or abilities, mental scars that paradoxically grant resistance to certain psychic effects, rare insights into [[Architects|Architect]] lore), making it a tempting but perilous endeavor.
