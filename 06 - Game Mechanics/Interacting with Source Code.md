# Interacting with Source Code

**[[s]]** is the [[Architects]]' structured manipulation of the [[World-Song]]. Interacting with it is often more technical or requires specific knowledge/tools. (See also: [[Quick Guide to Veridium#Player Character Focus|Player Character Focus]])

* **Wizards ([[Code Scriveners]] & [[Aetheric Scholars]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: View [[s]] as the ultimate arcane language. They can:
        * **Decipher [[Architect]] [[Code Glyphs]]**: Through intense study (Arcana, Investigation), they can attempt to understand and replicate the effects of [[Code Glyphs]] found on [[Architect]] ruins or artifacts, potentially learning new spells or rituals.
        * **Reverse-Engineer Devices**: Analyze [[Architect]] devices to understand the [[s]] principles behind them, allowing for the creation of new, mortal-scale magical items or technological innovations.
        * **"Code-Rewrite" Reality (High-Level/Risky)**: Exceptionally powerful wizards might attempt to directly manipulate localized [[s]] fields, effectively "editing" reality on a small scale. This is incredibly dangerous and could lead to [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]] blowback or unforeseen consequences.

* **Artificers ([[Techno-Savants]] of the [[Cogwork Concord]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: Focus on the practical application of [[s]] through machinery. They:
        * **Build Resonance Engines**: Create devices that safely tap, channel, and convert [[s]] energy into usable power for their inventions.
        * **Inscribe Control Runes**: Develop runic systems based on simplified [[Architect]] [[Code Glyphs]] to program automatons or control [[s]]-powered devices.
        * **Interface with [[Awakening Architect Systems|Architect Systems]]**: Attempt to interface with (or bypass) the control systems of [[Architect]] ruins and devices, often using specialized tools.
        * **Repair/Activate [[Architect]] Devices (Artefacts)**: With sufficient understanding of [[s]] and the right components (often rare or dangerous to acquire), Artificers might be able to repair damaged [[Architect]] artifacts or activate dormant ones, unlocking their original functions or new, unpredictable abilities. This often involves complex skill challenges and the risk of catastrophic failure.

* **Psions ([[Code-Sensitives]] & [[Mind-Linkers]] of the [[Aetheric Ascendancy]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: Interact with [[s]] on a purely mental level. They can:
        * **Sense [[s]] Signatures**: Detect the presence, intensity, and "flavor" of active [[s]] fields or artifacts.
        * **[[Resonance Tuning]]**: Attempt to mentally attune to a [[s]] device or field to understand its purpose, activate it, or even subtly influence its function.
        * **Extract Information**: "Read" information directly from [[Architect]] data crystals or psionically active [[Source Nodes]].

* **[[Gene-Shapers]] (Bio-Sorcerers of the [[Symbiotic Spires]])**:
    * **Mechanic**: Believe [[s]] is the fundamental language of genetics. They:
        * **Identify "Bio-Code"**: Find and isolate sequences of [[s]] embedded within living organisms or [[Architect]] bio-factories (like [[The Gene-Forge of Viridia]]).
        * **Integrate & Mutate**: Attempt to splice this Bio-Code into other life forms to grant new abilities, trigger specific mutations, or create entirely new symbiotic organisms.

### General Mechanic: [[s]] Interaction & [[Resonance Tuning]]

* **Skill Challenges**: Interacting with complex [[s]] (deciphering a major [[Code Glyphs|glyph]], activating a dormant [[Awakening Architect Systems|Architect system]], navigating a potent [[Source Node]]) should often be resolved through an extended skill challenge involving relevant skills (Arcana, Investigation, Technology (if used), Psionics, Nature, Survival, specific tool proficiencies).
* **Knowledge Checks**: Identifying the type, origin, or potential danger of a [[s]] manifestation would use Arcana, History, or specialized Lore skills.
