# The Age of Architects

**(Countless Millennia Ago - Ending with the [[Great Dissonance]])**

This was the foundational epoch of [[Veridium]] as it is known, defined by the presence and activities of the [[Architects]].

* **Key Events**:
    * The [[Architects]] arrive in or perceive [[Veridium]]'s nascent reality.
    * The **[[World-Song]]** is composed, bringing order to [[Primordial Chaos]].
    * Continents are shaped, oceans are formed, and foundational **[[Source Code]]** networks and [[Source Nodes]] are established.
    * Complex ecosystems and early, often hyper-advanced, life forms are engineered.
    * Vast [[Architect]] Citadels, [[Source Nodes]], and planetary-scale systems are constructed.
    * The period ends abruptly and catastrophically with **[[The Great Dissonance]]**.
