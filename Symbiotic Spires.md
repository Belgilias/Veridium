# The Symbiotic Spires

* **Core Philosophy**: Life is the ultimate medium for creation and power; evolution is a tool to be actively guided. They aim to *improve* upon nature through bio-engineering and forced evolution, viewing [[Source Code]] as the universe's ultimate genetic script. They revere [[Architects]] as Divine Bio-Shapers or Cosmic Gardeners.
* **Key Territories**: Primarily on [[Viridia]]. [[Spirejungles]] are a notable biome.
* **Leadership Example**: [[Matriarch Lyra’nix]] of the K’tharr Hive. She claims to receive direct visions from the [[Conductors|Conductor]] [[Myxos, the Shaper of Flesh]].
* **Technological Level**: Purely organic and bio-engineered; living weapons, tools, transport, and architecture. Some factions experiment with unstable bio-mechanical hybrids using [[Architect]] components. Mastery of gene-crafting and creation of vast bio-engineered structures and war-beasts.
* **Culture & Society**: Varies from hive-like collectives to caste systems based on genetic "purity" or bio-augmentations. Constant experimentation.
* **Pantheon**: [[The Cycle of Flesh and Bloom]]
* **Faction-Specific Cataclysm**: [[The Bloomwilde Contagion]]
* **Inter-Faction Dynamics**:
    * **[[Cogwork Concord]]**: Cold War, industrial espionage. *Nuance*: Certain Spire factions, desperate for an edge, might secretly purchase advanced analytical engines or power conduits from Concord smugglers to jumpstart complex bio-projects. Rogue Concord corporations may trade mechanical components to fringe Spire bio-smiths.
    * **[[Silent Weald]]**: Deep Ideological Rift. Raids by Weald purists to "cleanse" Spire "abominations" are met with fierce bio-engineered defenses. Occasionally, uneasy truces are formed against shared [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]]-related threats.
    * **[[Aetheric Ascendancy]]**: Curiosity mixed with suspicion. Some Spire [[Gene-Shapers]] are fascinated with bio-engineering psionic capabilities, a concept the Ascendancy finds both intriguing and horrifying.
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Gene-Twisted Aberrations]], [[Spore-Zombies]], [[Fungal Horrors]], [[Apex Bio-Predators]], [[Living Siege Engines]], [[Bio-Titans]], [[Symbiotic Horrors]], [[Bloomwilde Terrors]].
* **Player Interaction**: [[Gene-Shapers (Bio-Sorcerers of the Symbiotic Spires)]]
