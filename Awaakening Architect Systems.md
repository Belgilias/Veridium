# Awakening Architect Systems

A significant threat in [[Veridium]] comes from **[[Awakening Architect Systems]]**. These are dormant or previously quiescent creations of the [[Architects]] that are beginning to re-activate.

These systems can include:
* Dormant [[Architect]] citadels.
* [[Architect Remnants|Sentinels]] (automated guardians), which may become corrupted (e.g. [[Architect Sentinels (Corrupted)]]).
* Planetary-scale devices.

The intent behind their re-activation is unknown but is considered likely to be disruptive and dangerous to the current inhabitants of [[Veridium]]. Sages and mystics warn that their reawakening could contribute to a "[[Second Dissonance]]".
