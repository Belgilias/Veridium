# Echo Storms

**[[Echo Storms]]** are temporary, violent surges of Dissonant energy that can sweep across regions of [[Veridium]], lasting for hours or days. During an [[Echo Storm]], [[Dissonance Hotspots|reality warps]] unpredictably. Effects can include:
* Wild fluctuations in gravity.
* Temporal distortions (slowing, speeding, or looping locally).
* Inanimate objects animating with malevolent intent.
* Strong emotions manifesting physically.
* The appearance of creatures from "between the notes" of the [[World-Song]] ([[Dissonance Entities]] or [[Echo Storm Elementals]]).

Seeking shelter or finding a way to navigate and survive an [[Echo Storm]] is a common adventure challenge. Unpredictable [[Echo Storms]] are a component of [[Active Dissonance]]. The [[The Paradox Priests]], a cult within the [[Chronos Scavengers]], actively seek to trigger or manipulate [[Echo Storms]].
