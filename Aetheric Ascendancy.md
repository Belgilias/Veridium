# The Aetheric Ascendancy

* **Core Philosophy**: The mind is the ultimate reality and the path to transcendence. They seek to unlock the full potential of consciousness, viewing the physical world as a lesser state or an illusion. They view [[Architects]] as Transcended Minds or Beings of Pure Thought, and [[Source Code]] as solidified thought-patterns.
* **Key Territories**: Remote regions on [[Krystallos]]. Named Enclaves include: **[[The Crystal Spire of Althazar]]** (a major training and research facility), **[[The Silent Monolith of Xy'on]]** (a place of deep meditation and communion with [[The Crystal Harmony]]), and the legendary **[[Floating Sanctum of Aerthos]]** (rumored to drift through [[Krystallos]]'s upper atmosphere). The legendary [[The City of Silent Thought]] is also associated with them.
* **Leadership Example**: [[The Oracle of Resonant Peaks]] (collective consciousness). The current Speaker for the Oracle is an emissary of [[The Crystal Harmony]].
* **Technological Level**: Minimal conventional technology. "Devices" are psionically attuned crystals, thought-amplifiers, and mind-linked constructs. Refinement of psionic disciplines, creation of mind-powered constructs.
* **Culture & Society**: Often ascetic, monastic, and hierarchical, based on psionic talent. Practice highly efficient, psionically augmented hydroponics and atmospheric moisture harvesting. They mine [[Krystallos]] for unique psionically resonant crystals and engage in very limited, selective trade.
* **Pantheon**: [[The Silent Architects / The Mind Lords]]
* **Faction-Specific Cataclysm**: [[The Resonant Cascade]]
* **Internal Divisions**:
    * **[[Mind Weavers]]**: A rumored rogue faction seeking to psionically dominate other factions.
    * "Seeker Cults" covertly observe other societies.
    * "Purifier Factions" view any interaction as contamination.
* **Inter-Faction Dynamics**:
    * Generally Isolationist.
    * [[Cogwork Concord]]: Wary detachment, though some Concord universities seek psionic insights.
    * [[Symbiotic Spires]]: Curiosity mixed with suspicion regarding bio-engineering psionic capabilities.
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Thought Eaters]], [[Intellect Devourers]], [[Crystalline Golems (Thought-Forms)]], [[Mind Warpers]], [[Psychic Phantoms]], [[Ego Wraiths]], [[Resonance Beasts]], [[Krystallos Sand-Shapers]].
* **Player Interaction**: [[Psions (Code-Sensitives & Mind-Linkers of the Aetheric Ascendancy)]], [[Psions (Certain Disciplines - Resonant Minds)]]
