# Active Dissonance

**[[Active dissonance]]** refers to the ongoing and immediate manifestations of the fractured [[World-Song]] and corrupted [[s]] networks in [[Veridium]], stemming from the [[Great Dissonance]]. It encompasses several dynamic and dangerous phenomena:

* **Expanding [[Dissonance Hotspots]]**: These are regions where reality is unstable and actively warping. Some hotspots are growing, posing increasing danger to surrounding areas.
* **Unpredictable [[Echo Storms]]**: Violent, temporary surges of Dissonant energy that cause widespread reality-bending effects.
* **The Potential for a "[[Second Dissonance]]"**: A pervasive fear among some in [[Veridium]] that current events, mortal misuse of [[s]], or the reawakening of major [[Architect]] systems could trigger another cataclysm on the scale of the [[Great Dissonance]].

[[Active dissonance]] is a major threat category facing the inhabitants of [[Veridium]].
