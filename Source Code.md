# The Source Code

While the [[World-Song]] is the "natural" metaphysical fabric of [[Veridium]], the **[[Source Code]]** represents the [[Architects]]' *deliberate and structured manipulation* of it. It is the structured, often technological or arcane "language" the [[Architects]] used to manipulate, program, and build upon the [[World-Song]]. Think of the [[World-Song]] as the operating system of reality, and [[Source Code]] as the advanced programming language, complex applications, and intricate hardware the [[Architects]] created to run on it.

* **Manifestations**: It can appear as complex energy patterns, crystalline data storage, intricate [[Code Glyphs]], biological programs within organisms, the functional principles behind [[Architect]] devices, or even specific frequencies within the [[World-Song]] that trigger programmed effects.
* **[[Source Nodes]]**: These are crucial locations where the raw, natural power of the [[World-Song]] and the intricate, artificial structure of [[Architect]] [[Source Code]] intertwine powerfully. [[Source Nodes]] are often sites of immense magical energy, advanced [[Architect]] ruins, unique ecological phenomena, dangerous instability, or profound revelations. They are highly sought after and contested by all factions.

The relationship is thus: The [[World-Song]] *is* the fundamental reality; the [[Source Code]] is how the [[Architects]] *shaped, controlled, and enhanced* that reality for their inscrutable purposes. Mortals now grapple with understanding both the raw, often wild, Song and the complex, often dangerous, Code. Adventurers often hunt for potent [[Source Code]] artifacts. Interacting with [[Source Code]] can be done via mechanics like [[Resonance Tuning]].
