# Source Nodes

**[[Source Nodes]]** are potent and crucial locations across [[Veridium]] where the raw, natural power of the [[World-Song]] and the intricate, artificial structure of [[Architects|Architect]] [[Source Code]] intertwine powerfully.

These nodes are often sites of:
* Immense magical energy.
* Advanced [[Architects|Architect]] ruins and technology.
* Unique ecological phenomena.
* Dangerous instability and reality warps.
* Profound revelations and lore.

Due to their significance, [[Source Nodes]] are highly sought after and contested by all major factions. Examples include [[The Gene-Forge of Viridia]], [[The Orrery of Worlds]], and the rumored [[The Lost City of Aethel]]. Divine quests might even involve journeying to a major [[Source Node]].
