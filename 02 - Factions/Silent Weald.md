# The Silent Weald

* **Core Philosophy**: Communion with the spirit of nature, reverence for the original, untainted [[World-Song]], and protection of the primal energies of [[Veridium]]. They see [[Architects]] as Great Composers who initially brought harmony but some became too focused on control via [[s]], leading to the [[Great Dissonance]].
* **Key Territories**: The [[Primal Weald]] of [[Viridia]], with enclaves on other continents. The [[The World-Tree Enclave]] is their spiritual heart.
* **Leadership Example**: [[Elder Thawne]], Voice of the [[The World-Tree]] Conclave. [[The World-Tree]] communicates prophecies through [[Echo Listeners]] like him.
* **Technological Level**: Mundane tools are Neolithic to Iron Age. Advanced capabilities lie in potent druidic/shamanistic magic, spirit communion, and mastery of natural processes. Deepening communion with primal nature, potent elemental and spiritual magic.
* **Culture & Society**: Tribal, communal, or organized into druidic circles. Deep ancestral traditions.
* **Pantheon**: [[The Ancestral Chorus & Primal Spirits]]
* **Inter-Faction Dynamics**:
    * **[[Cogwork Concord]] & [[Symbiotic Spires]]**: Generally hostile due to ideological clashes and encroachment. *Nuance*: Occasionally, a specific Weald circle might form a temporary, uneasy truce with a Concord outpost or even a less radical Spire enclave to combat a shared, greater [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]]-related threat. These alliances are fraught with mistrust and usually short-lived.
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Elder Groots]], [[Awakened Trees]], [[Spirit Beasts]], [[Will-o'-the-Wisps]], Corrupted Sprites, [[Shambling Mounds of Infused Earth]], [[Living Topiaries]], [[Guardians of the Threshold]], [[Echoes of the Song]].
* **Player Interaction**: [[Druids & Rangers (Echo Listeners of the Silent Weald)]]
