# The Cogwork Concord

* **Core Philosophy**: Order through industry, progress through mechanical innovation, and the mastery of the physical world via steam, clockwork, and burgeoning aetheric science. They see the [[s]] primarily as a power source and a blueprint for ever more complex machines. They view [[Architects]] as Supreme Inventors and Engineers.
* **Key Territories**: Dominant across [[Aethelgard]]. Cities like [[Aethelburg]] are centers of industry and invention.
* **Leadership Example**: [[High Artificer Valerius Kane]] of [[Aethelburg]]. He was reputedly gifted initial schematics for [[Aethelburg]]'s Great Steam Core by the [[Conductors|Conductor]] [[Technos, the Great Artificer]].
* **Technological Level**: Advanced steam power, intricate clockwork automata, nascent aetherics/electricity, black powder firearms, experimental steam/aether weapons. Development of advanced automatons, railways, and early airships.
* **Culture & Society**: Highly structured, often stratified societies with powerful guilds. Emphasis on logic, efficiency, and quantifiable results. Prone to urban sprawl, pollution, and social unrest.
* **Pantheon**: [[The Synod of Pragmatic Progression]]
* **Faction-Specific Cataclysm**: [[The Iron Blight]]
* **Inter-Faction Dynamics**:
    * **[[Symbiotic Spires]]**: Cold War, industrial espionage. *Nuance*: Rumors persist of rogue Concord corporations secretly trading advanced mechanical components to fringe Spire bio-smiths for unique organic catalysts or defensive organisms, a dangerous black market benefiting both sides' more radical elements. Certain Spire factions might secretly purchase advanced analytical engines or power conduits from Concord smugglers.
    * **[[Silent Weald]]**: Active Hostility due to Concord expansion. Occasionally, uneasy truces are formed against shared [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]]-related threats.
    * **[[Aetheric Ascendancy]]**: Wary Detachment. *Nuance*: Some Concord universities maintain discreet "cultural exchange" programs with Ascendancy enclaves, hoping to glean insights into psionic theory for potential mechanization. Whispers of a secret Concord division attempting to capture and "study" Ascendancy psions.
    * **[[Chronos Scavengers]]**: Distrust, but occasionally used for rare salvage.
* **Associated Creatures**: [[Gear-Golems]], Rogue Automatons, [[Smog Mephits]], [[Toxin Elementals]], [[Scrap-Raptors]], [[Junkyard Stalkers]], [[The Brass Colossus]], [[Iron Behemoths]], [[Aether-Wraiths]], [[Source-Leeches]].
* **Player Interaction**: [[Artificers (Techno-Savants of the Cogwork Concord)]]
