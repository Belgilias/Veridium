# Monsters, Creatures, and Anomalies of Veridium

[[Veridium]] teems with life, much of it bizarre, dangerous, and uniquely adapted to or mutated by the diverse energies of the [[s]], the lingering effects of the [[Great Dissonance]], and the often reckless practices of its dominant societies.

## Creatures of the [[Cogwork Concord]] & [[Aethelgard]]

* **[[Gear-Golems]] & Rogue Automatons**: Discarded or rogue clockwork and steam-powered automatons.
* **[[Smog Mephits]] & [[Toxin Elementals]]**: Malevolent spirits of pollution.
* **[[Scrap-Raptors]] & [[Junkyard Stalkers]]**: Packs of scavengers adapted to industrial ruins.
* **[[The Brass Colossus]] / [[Iron Behemoths]]**: Legendary city-guardian automatons or repurposed [[Architect]] war-machines.
* **[[Aether-Wraiths]]**: Phantasmal beings formed from intense discharges of aetheric energy.
* **[[Source-Leeches]]**: Small, metallic creatures that attach to [[s]]-powered devices and drain their energy, often causing catastrophic malfunctions.

## Horrors of the [[Symbiotic Spires]] & [[Viridia]]

* **[[Gene-Twisted Aberrations]]**: Failed experiments or escaped bio-weapons with unpredictable mutations.
* **[[Spore-Zombies]] & [[Fungal Horrors]]** (Myconid Corruptions): Corpses reanimated by parasitic fungi.
* **[[Apex Bio-Predators]]**: Perfectly engineered hunting organisms.
* **[[Living Siege Engines]] / [[Bio-Titans]]**: Massive organisms bred for war.
* **[[Symbiotic Horrors]]**: Creatures that are a composite of multiple, interlocked organisms.
* **[[Bloomwilde Terrors]]**: Flora and fauna hyper-evolved by the [[The Bloomwilde Contagion]], exhibiting extreme aggression and bizarre new abilities (e.g., plants that hunt with sentient vines, insects that inject mutagens).

## Beasts and Spirits of the [[Silent Weald]] ([[Viridia]])

* **[[Elder Groots]] & [[Awakened Trees]]**: Ancient, sentient trees that defend their forests.
* **[[Spirit Beasts]]**: Normal animals infused with potent nature spirits, granting supernatural abilities.
* **[[Will-o'-the-Wisps]] & Corrupted Sprites**: Deceptive or malevolent nature spirits.
* **[[Shambling Mounds of Infused Earth]] / [[Living Topiaries]]**: Earth elementals or plant creatures animated by concentrated life energy.
* **[[Guardians of the Threshold]]**: Mystical creatures guarding sacred sites or spirit paths.
* **[[Echoes of the Song]]**: Benign (or sometimes sorrowful) spectral manifestations of animals or people who were deeply connected to the [[World-Song]], sometimes offering cryptic guidance.

## Phantoms and Constructs of the [[Aetheric Ascendancy]] ([[Krystallos]])

* **[[Thought Eaters]] & [[Intellect Devourers]]**: Psionic predators that feed on mental energy.
* **[[Crystalline Golems (Thought-Forms)]]**: Constructs of solidified psionic energy and crystal.
* **[[Mind Warpers]] & [[Psychic Phantoms]]**: Creatures projecting illusions or sowing madness.
* **[[Ego Wraiths]]**: Psychic remnants of powerful psions.
* **[[Resonance Beasts]]**: Animals native to [[Krystallos]] with natural psionic abilities.
* **[[Krystallos Sand-Shapers]]**: Large, insectoid creatures that psychically manipulate sand and crystal to create shifting lairs or deadly traps in the [[Resonant Deserts]].

## Anomalies of the [[Dissonance Frontier]] ([[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Shattered Concord]], [[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Sundered Isles]], [[Dissonance Hotspots]])

These regions are rife with creatures displaced in time, warped by unstable reality, or born from the raw chaos of the [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]].

* **[[Temporal Phantoms]] & [[Chronal Ectoplasm]]**: Creatures or individuals caught in time loops or phasing in and out of reality.
* **[[Dissonance Hounds]]**: Predatory, vaguely canine creatures that seem to be made of shifting, glitching reality. They can "unmake" small portions of their surroundings or inflict wounds that heal incorrectly or leave behind temporal scars.
* **[[Reality Weavers]]**: Spider-like entities that spin webs of distorted space-time, creating localized pockets of altered physics or trapping victims in small dimensional loops.
* **[[Echo Storm Elementals]]**: Temporary beings of pure Dissonant energy coalesced during an [[Echo Storm]], their forms and abilities wildly unpredictable (e.g., a storm of screaming faces, a vortex of liquid light that ages whatever it touches).
* **[[Architect Sentinels (Corrupted)]]**: Automated [[Architect]] guardians whose programming has been warped by the [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]], now attacking anything that approaches their assigned (and often nonsensical) posts with overwhelming force.
* **[[Source Code Elementals]] / [[Reality Glitches]]**: Unstable beings of raw, unbound [[s]] energy, or localized "glitches" in the [[World-Song]].
* **[[Leviathans of the Shattered Deeps]]**: Colossal, ancient beings (some biological, some [[Architect]] constructs) that inhabit the abyssal depths beneath the [[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Shattered Concord]], sometimes rising to the surface during major [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]] surges.
