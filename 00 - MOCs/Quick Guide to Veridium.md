# Quick Guide to Veridium (One-Page Summary)

## Core Concepts

* **[[Architects]]**: Ancient, hyper-advanced cosmic artisans (ranging from unfathomable [[Primordial Architects]] to [[Lesser Architects|Lesser Engineers]]) who shaped [[Veridium]] by composing/programming its fundamental reality. Their true purpose (creation, experiment, sanctuary?) is a major mystery.
* **[[World-Song]]**: The natural, metaphysical fabric and vibrational essence of [[Veridium]], dictating the laws of reality, magic, life, and consciousness. It's the "operating system" of the world.
* **[[s]]**: The structured, often technological or arcane "language" the [[Architects]] used to manipulate, program, and build upon the [[World-Song]]. It's the "advanced software" they ran on the [[World-Song]].
* **[[Source Nodes]]**: Potent locations where the raw [[World-Song]] and structured [[Architect]] [[s]] intertwine powerfully, creating areas of high magic, advanced (and often dangerous) [[Architect]] technology, unique phenomena, and intense conflict.
* **[[Great Dissonance]]**: A cataclysmic event that shattered/corrupted the [[World-Song]] and [[s]] networks, caused the [[Architects]] to vanish, and physically scarred [[Veridium]]. Its cause is debated ([[Architect]] war, external invasion, failed experiment). It is an *ongoing* threat.
* **[[Dissonance Hotspots]]**: Regions where the [[World-Song]] is actively unstable due to the [[Great Dissonance]], causing reality to warp, magic to be unpredictable, and strange creatures to manifest. Some are static, some expand, some shift.
* **[[Echo Storms]]**: Temporary, violent surges of Dissonant energy that sweep across regions, causing unpredictable reality-bending effects (gravity shifts, temporal mirages, thought manifestations, etc.).

## Major Factions (Societal Blocs)

* **[[Cogwork Concord]]**: ([[Aethelgard]]) Industrial, steam/clockwork tech, aetheric science, order through invention. *Leader Example: [[High Artificer Valerius Kane]]*.
* **[[Symbiotic Spires]]**: ([[Viridia]]) Bio-engineering, organic technology, forced evolution, life as the ultimate medium. *Leader Example: [[Matriarch Lyraâ€™nix]]*.
* **[[Silent Weald]]**: ([[Viridia]]) Primal nature magic, spirit communion, reverence for the untainted [[World-Song]]. *Leader Example: [[Elder Thawne]]*.
* **[[Aetheric Ascendancy]]**: ([[Krystallos]]) Psionic power, mental transcendence, consciousness as ultimate reality. *Leader Example: [[The Oracle of Resonant Peaks]]*.
* **[[Chronos Scavengers]]**: (Nomadic, [[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Sundered Isles]]/[[Dissonance Frontier]]) Salvagers of lost tech and temporal anomalies, pragmatic survivors. *Leader Example: [[Captain Glitch Anachronos]]*.

## Major Threats

* **[[Active dissonance]]**: Expanding [[Dissonance Hotspots]], unpredictable [[Echo Storms]], and the potential for a "Second [[Dissonance]]".
* **[[Awakening Architect Systems]]**: Dormant [[Architect]] citadels, [[Architect Remnants|Sentinels]], or planetary-scale devices re-activating with unknown, likely disruptive, intent.
* Faction-Specific Cataclysms:
    * **[[The Iron Blight]]** ([[Cogwork Concord]] Origin): Techno-organic plague animating metal.
    * **[[The Bloomwilde Contagion]]** ([[Symbiotic Spires]] Origin): Hyper-aggressive, mutating ecosystem.
    * **[[The Resonant Cascade]]** ([[Aetheric Ascendancy]] Origin): Destructive waves of psychic energy.
* Inter-Factional Warfare: The constant cold war and resource competition threatening to boil over.
* **[[The Cacophony Strain]]**: The theorized external cause of the [[Great Dissonance]], possibly still subtly corrupting [[Veridium]] or seeking re-entry.

## Player Character Focus

Adventurers in [[Veridium]] often find themselves:
* Exploring dangerous [[Architect]] ruins and [[Dissonance Hotspots]].
* Hunting for potent [[s]] artifacts and [[Architect]] devices.
* Navigating the complex politics and espionage between factions.
* Battling monstrous creatures born of [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]] or factional experiments.
* Seeking to understand or even heal the fractured [[World-Song]], or conversely, exploiting its broken state for power.
* Interacting directly with the world's metaphysics through mechanics like **[[Resonance Tuning]]** (a high-risk, high-reward way to interface with [[s]]).
