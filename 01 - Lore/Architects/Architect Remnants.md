# Architect Remnants (Echo Minds & Sentinels)

**[[Architect Remnants]]** are not true [[Architects]], but rather vestiges left behind from their era. They represent fragments of [[Architects|Architect]] consciousness, hyper-advanced AI systems, automated guardians (Sentinels), or even specialized biological constructs.

These are the most "common" (though still incredibly rare and dangerous) forms of [[Architects|Architect]] legacy encountered by mortals in [[Veridium]].

* **Echo Minds**: May represent stored consciousness or sophisticated AI.
* **Sentinels**: Automated guardians, often powerful and dedicated to inscrutable tasks. When their programming is warped by the [[Great Dissonance]], they can become [[Architect Sentinels (Corrupted)]], attacking anything that approaches.

The re-activation of dormant [[Architect Remnants]] is a key aspect of the threat posed by [[Awakening Architect Systems]].
