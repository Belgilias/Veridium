# Elder Architects

The **Elder Architects** represent a significant tier within the [[Architects]]' hierarchy, positioned below the enigmatic [[Primordial Architects]] and above the more numerous [[Lesser Architects]]. They are often revered or acknowledged as the master designers and overseers responsible for many of the grand-scale features and systems of [[Veridium]].

## Identity and Recognition

Unlike the almost entirely incomprehensible [[Primordial Architects]], the Elder Architects are sometimes known by cryptic names or symbols. These identifiers are typically found in the deepest, most ancient ruins or are inferred from the sheer scale and complexity of their grandest creations. Examples of such inferred names include:

* **"[[Xylos, the Weaver of Forms]]"**, potentially linked to phenomena like [[The Petrified Garden of Xylos]].
* **"Solarian, the Light Harmonist"**
* **"Cygnus, the Star-Mapper"**

## Key Roles in Shaping Veridium

The Elder Architects were likely the primary agents for several monumental tasks in the early age of [[Veridium]]:

* **Continental Shaping**: They are believed to have overseen the formation and arrangement of [[Veridium]]'s continents.
* **Foundational [[s]] Systems**: The Elder Architects were probably responsible for engineering the foundational networks and systems of [[s]] that underpin many of [[Veridium]]'s advanced functions and arcane principles.
* **Planetary-Scale Ecological Engineering**: They likely designed and implemented vast ecosystems across the planet.

## The Shaping Chorus: Refining Reality

Following the [[Primordial Architects]]' "First Canticle" which established the [[Elemental Primes]] and basic laws, the Elder Architects, along with [[Lesser Architects]], participated in what is known as **"The Shaping Chorus."** During this period, they:

* Further refined the [[World-Song]], building upon the initial composition of the [[Primordial Architects]].
* Coaxed forth complex ecosystems from the raw potential established.
* Shaped the continents into their recognizable forms.
* Laid the groundwork for the emergence of intricate life.
* Life that developed under their direct guidance was often qualitatively different from later forms, sometimes described as fluid, hyper-advanced, or even purely energetic.

The grand and often perilous ruins, along with the vast, automated systems still found on [[Veridium]], stand as testaments to the Elder Architects' immense power and their pivotal role in molding the world.
