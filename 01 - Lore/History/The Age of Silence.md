# The Age of Silence

**(Approx. 10,000 - 5,000 years BPD)**

This era immediately followed [[The Great Dissonance]] and was characterized by a wounded, volatile world.

* **Key Events**:
    * *The Aftermath of [[Great Dissonance]]*: [[Veridium]] is a scarred world. Raw energies of the fractured [[World-Song]] are volatile. [[Architects|Architect]] ruins stand silent or actively malfunction. The [[World-Song]] is fractured; the [[Architects]] vanish or fall silent. Continents are reshaped, and raw magical energies ravage the world.
    * *Survival of the Fittest*: Earliest mortal races (primitive humanoids, resilient insectoids, adaptive fungal networks, etc.) emerge or are catastrophically reduced, struggling to survive in a hostile, ever-changing environment often characterized by [[Dissonance Hotspots]] and [[Echo Storms]].
    * *Whispers of the Lost*: First, fearful encounters with the incomprehensible [[Architects|Architect]] ruins. These sites are sources of terror, superstition, and dangerous energies.
    * *The Long Dark*: Millennia of slow adaptation. Magic is wild, untamed, and often lethal if stumbled upon. Understanding of the world is minimal.
