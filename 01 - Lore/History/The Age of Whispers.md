# The Age of Whispers (The Awakening Epoch)

**(Approx. 5,000 - 2,000 BPD)**

During this period, mortal races began to subtly interact with the remnants of the [[Architects|Architect]]'s legacy and the damaged [[World-Song]].

* **Key Events**:
    * *The First Shamans & Mystics*: Mortal sensitives begin to intuitively react to and subtly influence the fainter Echoes of the [[Source Code]] and the damaged [[World-Song]]. They learn to navigate or appease local spirits and minor [[Great Dissonance|Dissonance]] effects.
    * *Birth of Animism & Proto-Religions*: Rudimentary belief systems form, often centered on worshipping the spirits of place, the raw power of the elements (themselves resonating with the [[World-Song]]), or awe-inspiring (and terrifying) [[Architects|Architect]] sites.
    * *Rise of the First "[[Conductors]]"*: Powerful individuals, or perhaps collective consciousnesses, begin to more consciously (or semi-consciously) channel fragments of the [[World-Song]] or resonate with potent [[Source Code]] nexuses ([[Source Nodes]]), gaining influence and laying the groundwork for future deities.
    * *Early Settlements & Oral Traditions*: Small, often nomadic or highly defensive settlements begin to appear. Oral traditions carry fragmented, mythologized tales of the "Sky Gods" ([[Architects]]) and the "World-Breaking" ([[Great Dissonance]]).
