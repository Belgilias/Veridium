# The Age of Discovery (The Unveiling Epoch)

**(Approx. 2,000 - 500 BPD)**

This era saw crucial breakthroughs in understanding and utilizing the [[Architects|Architect]]'s legacy, leading to the dawn of true civilizations.

* **Key Events**:
    * *The Unveiling of Fragments*: Crucial breakthroughs occur as certain cultures begin the first successful deciphering of simple [[Code Glyphs]] or manage to activate minor, relatively stable [[Architects|Architect]] devices. This is not a single event but a slow dawn across [[Veridium]].
    * *Dawn of Civilizations*: The rise of the first true city-states and nascent empires, often founded near defensible [[Architects|Architect]] ruins, areas rich in accessible [[Source Code]] (like geothermal vents in [[Aethelgard]]), or particularly fertile "living code" regions in [[Viridia]].
    * *The Schism of Knowledge*: Different cultural approaches to the [[Source Code]] begin to solidify, leading to distinct technological and philosophical paths.
        * [[Aethelgard]]: Early experiments with steam power derived from geothermal [[Architects|Architect]] tech.
        * [[Viridia]]: First attempts at understanding and manipulating "living code," rudimentary bio-shaping.
        * [[Krystallos]]: Recognition of psionically resonant crystals and the dawning of mental disciplines.
        * [[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Sundered Isles]]: Development of advanced seafaring and salvage techniques to explore coastal [[Architects|Architect]] ruins.
    * *The First Resource Wars*: As the value of [[Source Code]] and [[Architects|Architect]] artifacts becomes apparent, conflicts erupt between emerging civilizations over control of key sites and resources.
