# The Great Dissonance

The **[[Great Dissonance]]** was a cataclysmic event that shattered or corrupted the [[World-Song]] and [[s]] networks across [[Veridium]]. This event caused the [[Architects]] to vanish or fall silent and physically scarred the world. Its exact cause is debated, with theories including an [[Architect]] war, an external invasion, or a failed [[Architect]] experiment.

It is an *ongoing* threat. The [[Great Dissonance]] is the origin of [[Dissonance Hotspots]] and phenomena like [[Echo Storms]]. There are fears of a potential "Second [[Dissonance]]". The [[The Cacophony Strain]] is a theorized external cause of the [[Great Dissonance]]. The [[Chronos Scavengers]], particularly the [[The Paradox Priests]] cult, interact with its chaotic nature.
