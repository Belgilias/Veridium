# Code Glyphs

**[[Code Glyphs]]** are a common manifestation of [[s]] in [[Veridium]]. They are intricate symbols or patterns, often found inscribed on [[Architects|Architect]] ruins, devices, or artifacts.

* **Nature**: They represent a form of the "language" or "programming" used by the [[Architects]] to structure reality and control their technology.
* **Deciphering**: During [[The Age of Discovery]], crucial breakthroughs occurred as cultures began the first successful deciphering of simple [[Code Glyphs]].
* **Player Interaction**: [[Wizards (Code Scriveners & Aetheric Scholars)]] can attempt to decipher these glyphs to understand and replicate their effects, potentially learning new spells or rituals. [[Artificers (Techno-Savants of the Cogwork Concord)]] may develop runic systems based on simplified [[Architect]] glyphs to program automatons.
