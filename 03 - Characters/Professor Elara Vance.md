# Professor Elara Vance

**[[Professor Elara Vance]]** was a researcher whose work into [[Architects|Architect]]-related technologies was significant.

* Her research into neural interfaces was later perverted into [[Project Chimera]] (also potentially related to [[The Aethelburg Algorithm]]). This project involved the implantation of neural interface chips to control automatons and stemmed from her research into [[Architects|Architect]]-related technologies.
* Before its corruption, her research was rumored to have been inspired by fragmented texts allegedly linked to [[Sylvans, the Silent Harmony]], the Lost [[Conductors|Conductor]]. Her original aim may have been to find a way to harmonize consciousness rather than control it.
* This connection suggests she might have been, or had ties to, **[[The Seekers of Sylvans]]**.
