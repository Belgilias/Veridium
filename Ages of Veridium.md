# The Ages of Veridium: A Condensed Timeline & Key Events

[[Veridium]]'s history is a vast tapestry woven from the threads of cosmic creation, cataclysm, and the relentless efforts of mortal races to understand and master the echoes of a bygone era. This timeline provides a streamlined overview of its major epochs. (BPD = Before Present Day, roughly corresponding to the start of a typical campaign).

1.  **[[The Age of Architects]] (Countless Millennia Ago - Ending with the [[Great Dissonance]])**
    * The [[Architects]] arrive/perceive [[Veridium]].
    * The **[[World-Song]]** is composed.
    * Continents shaped, foundational **[[Source Code]]** networks established.
    * Complex ecosystems and early life engineered.
    * Vast [[Architect]] Citadels, [[Source Nodes]], and planetary-scale systems constructed.
    * Ends with **[[The Great Dissonance]]**.

2.  **[[The Age of Silence]] (Approx. 10,000 - 5,000 years BPD)**
    * *Aftermath of [[Great Dissonance]]*: Veridium wounded, volatile energies. [[Architect]] ruins silent/malfunctioning. The [[World-Song]] is fractured; the [[Architects]] vanish or fall silent. Continents are reshaped, and raw magical energies ravage the world.
    * *Survival of the Fittest*: Earliest mortal races (primitive humanoids, resilient insectoids, adaptive fungal networks, etc.) emerge or are catastrophically reduced, struggling to survive in a volatile and hostile environment. [[Dissonance Hotspots]] and [[Echo Storms]] common.
    * *Whispers of the Lost*: First, fearful encounters with the incomprehensible [[Architect]] ruins. These sites are often sources of terror and superstition.
    * *The Long Dark*: Millennia of slow adaptation, with little understanding of the forces shaping the world. Magic, if present, is wild, dangerous, and purely instinctual.

3.  **[[The Age of Whispers]] (The Awakening Epoch) (Approx. 5,000 - 2,000 BPD)**
    * *First Shamans & Mystics*: Mortal sensitives begin to intuitively react to and subtly influence the fainter Echoes of [[Source Code]] and the damaged [[World-Song]].
    * *Birth of Animism & Proto-Religions*: Rudimentary belief systems form, often centered on worshipping the spirits of place, the raw power of the elements (themselves resonating with the [[World-Song]]), or awe-inspiring (and terrifying) [[Architect]] sites.
    * *Rise of the First "[[Conductors]]"*: Powerful individuals, or perhaps collective consciousnesses, begin to more consciously (or semi-consciously) channel fragments of the [[World-Song]] or resonate with potent [[Source Code]] nexuses ([[Source Nodes]]), gaining influence and laying the groundwork for future deities.
    * *Early Settlements*: Small, often nomadic or highly defensive settlements begin to appear, sometimes cautiously forming near (but not within) less volatile [[Architect]] ruins. Oral traditions carry fragmented, mythologized tales of the "Sky Gods" ([[Architects]]) and the "World-Breaking" ([[Great Dissonance]]).

4.  **[[The Age of Discovery]] (The Unveiling Epoch) (Approx. 2,000 - 500 BPD)**
    * *Unveiling of Fragments*: Crucial breakthroughs occur as certain cultures begin the first successful deciphering of simple [[Code Glyphs]] or manage to activate minor, relatively stable [[Architect]] devices. This is not a single event but a slow dawn across [[Veridium]].
    * *Dawn of Civilizations*: The rise of the first true city-states and nascent empires, often founded near defensible [[Architect]] ruins, areas rich in accessible [[Source Code]] (like geothermal vents in [[Aethelgard]]), or particularly fertile "living code" regions in [[Viridia]].
    * *Schism of Knowledge*: Distinct cultural approaches to [[Source Code]] begin to solidify, leading to distinct technological and philosophical paths.
        * [[Aethelgard]]: Early experiments with steam power derived from geothermal [[Architect]] tech.
        * [[Viridia]]: First attempts at understanding and manipulating "living code," rudimentary bio-shaping.
        * [[Krystallos]]: Recognition of psionically resonant crystals and the dawning of mental disciplines.
        * [[Sundered Isles and Shattered Concord|Sundered Isles]]: Development of advanced seafaring and salvage techniques to explore coastal [[Architect]] ruins.
    * *First Resource Wars*: Conflicts over [[Source Code]] and [[Architect]] artifacts. As the value of [[Source Code]] and [[Architect]] artifacts becomes apparent, conflicts erupt between emerging civilizations over control of key sites and resources.

5.  **[[The Age of Divergence]] (The Fractured Harmony Epoch) (Approx. 500 BPD - Present Day)**
    * *Solidification of Societal Blocs*: [[Cogwork Concord]], [[Symbiotic Spires]], [[Silent Weald]], [[Aetheric Ascendancy]], [[Chronos Scavengers]] established, each with their own territories, ambitions, and methods of exploiting (or preserving) the [[Architect]]'s legacy.
    * *Technological/Philosophical Acceleration*: Rapid advancements along chosen paths.
        * [[Cogwork Concord]]: Automatons, railways, airships. [[Aethelburg]] industrial center.
        * [[Symbiotic Spires]]: Gene-crafting, bio-structures, war-beasts.
        * [[Silent Weald]]: Deep nature communion, elemental/spiritual magic.
        * [[Aetheric Ascendancy]]: Psionic disciplines, mind-powered constructs.
    * *[[The Aethelburg Algorithm]] & Similar Crises*: Incidents like [[Project Chimera]] (neural interfaces via [[Professor Elara Vance]]'s research) highlight dangers of rediscovered [[Source Code]]. Such events become more frequent across [[Veridium]] as ambition outpaces understanding.
    * *[[Source Code]] Rush Intensifies*: Global competition for [[Architect]] ruins and [[Source Code]]. Espionage, proxy wars, and reckless expeditions become common.
    * *Looming Shadow & "Second [[Dissonance]]" Whispers*: Increased [[Dissonance Hotspot]] activity, fear of new cataclysm from [[Source Code]] misuse or [[Awakening Architect Systems]]. Sages, mystics, and fringe scientists across [[Veridium]] note reality fraying at the edges and the awakening of ancient, ill-understood threats. Present Day: innovation, danger, uncertainty.
