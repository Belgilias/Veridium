# Dissonance Hotspots

**[[Dissonance Hotspots]]** are regions of varying size found across all continents of [[Veridium]] where the [[World-Song]] remains actively unstable due to the lingering effects of the [[Great Dissonance]]. In these areas, reality is mutable and prone to strange phenomena such as localized gravity shifts, flora and fauna mutations, spontaneous manifestation of energy or creatures, and sensory distortions.

Some hotspots are shrinking, while others are dangerously expanding, becoming active threats that factions might try to contain, exploit, or escape. They are a common feature explored by adventurers. Expanding [[Dissonance Hotspots]] contribute to [[Active Dissonance]]. [[Chronos Scavengers]] often set up outposts near major [[Dissonance Hotspots]].
